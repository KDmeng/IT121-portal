       <p>I am an aspiring software engineer currently at the Year Up program. I am student seeking to perfecting my craft and closing the opportunity divide that I have been dealt with through Year Up.</p>

       <p> Year Up is an internship program that teaches a variety of knowledge to student based on their interest, closing the opportunity job divide for all to be treated equally. I am currently learning the in working on how to work and apply with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Microsoft Office and various soft and hard skills needed to excel in any work environment I am place in.</p>
        
        <P>My future aspiration outside of my work aspiration and passion, is to further work into giving back the opportunity that I have received. I wish to become a torchbearer for others, as Year Up became the torchbearer for me.</p>

        <p>Little bit about myself, is I am very passionate avid reader, I enjoy a lot of different literary work, my personal favorites being autobiographies. They have always bring sense of achievement to myself, in a way I see myself in their place as if I am reading my own autobiography, which leads me to be engage even more in my effort for success in future. My personal favorite was the historical life legends and events of Steve Job, a man who carried a passionate dream of the tech future.</p>

       <p> I also have a big passion in investing, seeing my money rise and fall, double or lose, is an interesting part of the investment, it teaches you to be patient and open your mind to see opportunities. Especially so, when your investment hits, it brings another feeling of spiritual pleasure to see success in what you do. My personal interest mainly focuses on crypto currencies, its little bit easier to work on rather than stocks, although I do work on stocks too. Investing is also great way of accumulating currency, and teaching investors to think out of the box and see opportunities.</p>
